# Flask Tailwind Todo App

This is a Todo Application written with Flask (Python). It uses SQLite and SQLAlchemy.

In the past I have only used Python for scripting so I wanted to try building a web application with it. Django seemed like overkill for a small web app so I tried out Flask.

I also am using this project to experiment with Tailwind CSS.
